# MooBot
A Perl-based scallable IRC bot with plugin and language support

## Current Status
This project is currently in development. While it will likely run if you try it, it's highly *not* recommended you do that just yet.
I am looking for alpha testers to help me flush out the bot when the development is ready. If you're interested, please send me a message.

## Issues and Bugs
Please add all issues and bugs to the "issues" tab on the GitHub project page.
If you have suggestions for improvement, or general requests, add them to the "issues" with the "Suggestion" tag.

## Purpose
This program was created as an easy-to-use IRC automated bot for general use purposes. There package was created under the following general premises:

*  **"Dummy" proof**
   
   The bot should be programmed in such a way where individual users can install and operate it without knowing perl or any other code.
*  **Configurable**
   
    As many of the bot operations and configuration should be controlled by the user.
*  **Scallable and Expandable**

   * There should be options to add or remove bot operations using plugins.
   * Plugins should be easy to program by an external developer.
